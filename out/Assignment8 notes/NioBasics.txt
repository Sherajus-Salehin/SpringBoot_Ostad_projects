Introduction to Java NIO with Examples
Last Updated : 15 Jul, 2025
Java IO(Input/Output) is used to perform read and write operations. The java.io package contains all the classes required for input and output operation. Whereas, Java NIO (New IO) was introduced from JDK 4 to implement high-speed IO operations. It is an alternative to the standard IO API’s. In this article, we will understand more about Java NIO. Java NIO(New Input/Output) is high-performance networking and file handling API and structure which works as an alternative IO API for Java. It is introduced from JDK 4. Java NIO works as the second I/O system after standard Java IO with some added advanced features. It provides a different way of working with I/O than the standard IO. Like Java.io package which contains all the classes required for Java input and output operations, the java.nio package defines the buffer classes which are used throughout NIO APIs. We use Java NIO for the following two main reasons:
Non-blocking IO operation: Java NIO performs non-blocking IO operations. This means that it reads the data whichever is ready. For instance, a thread can ask a channel to read the data from a buffer and the thread can go for other work during that period and continue again from the previous point where it has left. In the meantime, the reading operation is complete which increases the overall efficiency.
Buffer oriented approach: Java NIO's buffer oriented approach allows us to move forth and back in the buffer as we need. The data is read into a buffer and cached there. Whenever the data is required, it is further processed from the buffer.
The main working of the Java NIO package is based on some core components. They are:
Buffers: Buffers are available in this package for the primitive data types. Java NIO is a buffer oriented package. It means that the data can be written/read to/from a buffer which further processed using a channel. Here, the buffers act as a container for the data as it holds the primitive data types and provides an overview of the other NIO packages. These buffers can be filled, drained, flipped, rewind, etc.
Channels: Channels are the new primitive I/O abstraction. A channel is a bit like stream used for communicating with the outside world. From the channel, we can read the data into a buffer or write from a buffer. Java NIO performs the non-blocking IO operations and the channels are available for these IO operations. The connection to different entities is represented by various channels which are capable of performing non-blocking I/O operation. The channels work as a medium or a gateway.
